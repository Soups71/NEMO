# NEMO Documentation

Welcome to NEMO—the **NMEA2000 Education and Maritime Operations Platform**.

NEMO is a research platform for exploring at maritime network security. It simulates sensors, sniffs traffic, and demonstrates just how easy you can mess with NMEA2000.

This platform focuses on lowering the bar for getting started with boat hacking. Typically to get started with boat hacking you would need thousands of dollars worth of equipment or a friend with a boat. Thankfully, with NEMO all you need is about 40 dollars.



## What's In Here

### Getting Your Feet Wet
1. **[Project Overview](Documentation/README.md)** - What this is and why boats need better security
2. **[Getting Started](Documentation/Getting_Started.md)** - From zero to flashing firmware
3. **[Operations Guide](Documentation/Operations_Guide.md)** - How to actually use the thing
4. **[FAQ](Documentation/FAQ.md)** - "Why doesn't X work?" answered here

### Understanding the Protocols
1. **[NMEA2000 Protocol](Documentation/NMEA2000.md)** - The marine standard for device communication

### Hardware
1. **[Design Reference](Documentation/PCB_Design.md)** - Schematics, layout, gerbers
2. **[3-D Printed Case](Documentation/Case_Design.md)** - Documentation on the case

### Software
9. **[Source Code Architecture](Documentation/Source_Code_Architecture.md)** - Deep dive into the firmware

### The Fun Part
10. **[Security Research & Attacks](Documentation/Attacks.md)** - How the attacks work and academic context



## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Get parts from [Hardware Guide](Documentation/PCB_Design.md)
2. Flash firmware via [Getting Started](Documentation/Getting_Started.md)
3. Learn the UI in [Operations Guide](Documentation/Operations_Guide.md)
4. Break Stuff
5. Profit!



## What This Is For

NEMO exists for:
- **Security researchers** exploring maritime vulnerabilities
- **Students** learning about CAN bus and protocol weaknesses
- **Industry folks** who want to see why NMEA2000 security matters
